Consider how many nodes are in the nth level down of a binary tree:

n = 1: 1 = 2^0
n = 2: 2 = 2^1
n = 3: 4 = 2^2

The pattern is that the nth level down will have 2 ^ (n - 1) nodes in it.

Now consider how many nodes are in a tree of height h. It will be the sum of all levels. So if the height is h, it will be:

2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(h - 1). This equals 2^h - 1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_4_%2B_8_%2B_â‹¯#Summation).

The representation of the tree needs to have one column for each node in a full tree of the given tree's height, according to the rules given, so the width will need to be 2^h - 1.
