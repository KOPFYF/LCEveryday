Soln 3 (Hash table Remapping) O(B) processing - O(1) pick/O(B)
Optimal Solution!

Hash map blacklisted value in [0, N-len(blacklist)) to whitelisted value in [N-len(blacklist), N), and then randomly pick number in [0, N-len(blacklist)).

pick one from whitelist by find the largest B[mid] less than the W[k]

Soln 3 (Hash table Remapping) O(B) processing - O(1) pick/O(B)
Optimal Solution!
Treat the first N - |B| numbers as those we can pick from. Iterate through the blacklisted numbers and map each of them to to one of the remaining non-blacklisted |B| numbers

For picking, just pick a random uniform int in 0, N - |B|. If its not blacklisted, return the number. If it is, return the number that its mapped to
